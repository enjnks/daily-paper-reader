Abstract 

Digital twins (DTs), serving as the core enablers for real-time monitoring and predictive maintenance of complex cyber-physical systems, impose critical requirements on their virtual models: high predictive accuracy, strong interpretability, and online adaptive capability. However, existing techniques struggle to meet these demands simultaneously: Bayesian methods excel in uncertainty quantification but lack model interpretability, while interpretable symbolic identification methods (e.g., SINDy) are constrained by their offline, batch-processing nature, which make real-time updates challenging. To bridge this semantic and computational gap, this paper proposes a novel Bayesian Regression-based Symbolic Learning (BRSL) framework. The framework formulates online symbolic discovery as a unified probabilistic state-space model. By incorporating sparse horseshoe priors, model selection is transformed into a Bayesian inference task, enabling simultaneous system identification and uncertainty quantification. Furthermore, we derive an online recursive algorithm with a forgetting factor and establish precise recursive conditions that guarantee the well-posedness of the posterior distribution. These conditions also function as real-time monitors for data utility, enhancing algorithmic robustness. Additionally, a rigorous convergence analysis is provided, demonstrating the convergence of parameter estimates under persistent excitation conditions. Case studies validate the effectiveness of the proposed framework in achieving interpretable, probabilistic prediction and online learning. 

Key words: Nonlinear time-varying systems; Bayesian recursive symbolic learning; Uncertainty analysis. 

1 Introduction 

The rise of digital twins (DTs) as core enablers for the industrial metaverse and autonomous systems is driving a paradigm shift in the modeling, monitoring, and con-trol of complex cyber-physical systems [17,20]. A high-fidelity DT is more than a static virtual model; it is a dy-namic, evolving computational entity that continuously interacts with its physical counterpart via tight integra-tion of data, models, and connectivity [11]. The perfor-mance of this coupling depends on the virtual model’s ability to fulfill three key requirements: predictive accu-racy under uncertainty, interpretability of the underly-ing governing laws, and real-time adaptability to stream-

ing data [22]. Uncertainty in the physical world is a fundamental challenge in the construction and deployment of com-plex systems. In response, a substantial line of research has focused on real-time adaptability and predictive ac-curacy under uncertainty within a Bayesian framework. This approach includes techniques such as Bayesian compressive sensing—which leverages sparsity-inducing priors (e.g., Laplace [10], Horseshoe [5,13]) to enable uncertainty-aware signal recovery. It also encompasses recursive Bayesian inference methods that underpin adaptive filtering [7] and state estimation [18], together providing a principled methodology for online learning. Nevertheless, these advanced methods are predomi-nantly applied to state and parameter estimation within fixed model structures or to black-box function approx-imation [23,14]. As a result, although they excel in un-certainty quantification (thereby enhancing predictive accuracy) and computational efficiency (enabling real-time operation), they often sacrifice interpretability by failing to produce explicit symbolic descriptions of the underlying system dynamics [21,19].

In contrast, state-of-the-art methods for deriving interpretable models, particularly those based on the Sparse Identification of Nonlinear Dynamics (SINDy) paradigm [8], excel at discovering parsimonious govern-ing equations from data. Variants like G-SINDy [15] and MGSINDy [16] have extended this framework to multi-input multi-output systems and incorporated noise decomposition, thus addressing aspects of predictive accuracy. Despite these strengths, their core limitation lies in the real-time domain: they operate within an of-fline, batch-processing paradigm that inherently relies on iteratively solving non-convex, often NP-hard, op-timization problems. This computational intractability creates a critical gap for DT applications that require online, continual adaptation [6]. Consequently, a core challenge persists: the lack of a unified framework that delivers interpretability, proba-bilistic predictive accuracy, and real-time efficiency. This work is motivated by two fundamental and intercon-nected scientific problems: 

The Semantic Gap between Interpretability and Uncertainty Quantification. A fundamental divide exists between interpretable symbolic modeling and probabilistic uncertainty quantification. While the former produces transparent models lacking uncertainty bounds, the latter provides predictive distributions at the expense of interpretability. Bridging this gap re-quires a new formalism that intrinsically unifies both capabilities. 

The Computational Gap between Batch and Streaming Inference. Translating high-fidelity sym-bolic discovery from offline batch processing to online streaming poses a fundamental challenge, necessitating a shift from iterative optimization to recursive estima-tion while preserving numerical stability and statistical efficiency. To this end, a novel Bayesian Regression-based Sym-bolic Learning (BRSL) framework is proposed. The con-tributions of this work are threefold: 

• A unified probabilistic state-space model for online symbolic discovery that bridges deterministic sym-bolic regression and Bayesian inference. By incor-porating sparsity-inducing horseshoe priors, model-structure selection is cast as Bayesian inference, enabling simultaneous system identification and un-certainty quantification. 

• An online recursive algorithm with a forgetting fac-tor, together with precise recursive conditions that en-sure posterior validity and well-posedness which also serve as a real-time data-utility monitor and enhance robustness. 

• A rigorous convergence analysis establishes the con-vergence of parameter estimates under persistent ex-citation, thereby ensuring provable stability and per-formance. The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. Sec.2 provides the problem formulation. Sec.3 details the main algorithm and provides supporting proofs. Sec.4 validates the algorithm through two case studies. Fi-nally, Sec.5 concludes the paper. 

2 Problem formulation 

Consider a general nonlinear time-varying system 

yd,α = f β (xd,α , α ) , (1) where α denotes continuous-time index; yd,α ∈ Rny de-notes the observation vector; xd,α ∈ Rnx denotes the state vector. For notational convenience, it is assumed that xd,α encompasses both state variables and oper-ational input variables, and f β represents a nonlinear mapping. Data sampled at discrete time instants αt ∈ [0 , ∞)(with t = 1 , 2, ... indexes the sampled data points) be de-noted as yd,α t and xd,α t . For simplicity, define yd,α t =

yd,t and xd,α t = xd,t . The dataset combining these ob-servations and states is then given by 

D =

Y d,t = [ yd, 1; yd, 2; . . . ; yd,t ],

Xd,t = [ xd, 1; xd, 2; . . . ; xd,t ]



, (2) where Y d,t ∈ Rt×ny represents observation matrix, and 

Xd,t ∈ Rt×nx represents the state matrix, satisfying 

Y d,t = f β (Xd,t , t ) . (3) In the symbolic learning framework, the structure of the governing equations is partially or completely un-known. Consequently, to learn interpretable dynamical equations, a common approach is to approximate the drift function by a sparse linear combination of prede-fined basis functions 

f β (Xd,t , t ) = ψ1(Xd,t )β1 + f ϕ(Xd,t , t )β2, (4) where f ϕ denotes the known drift function of the dynam-ics, such as the first principles; ψ1 denotes the library of basis functions defined by symbol learning, which is typically constructed from polynomials 

ψ1(Xd,t ) =

XPi

represents all polynomials of i degree in Xd,t .In order to keep notational consistency, the dictionary function is defined as Ψd =

h

ψ1 f ϕ

i

∈ Rt×np .2To sum up, the problem of interest is to describe the point prediction problem as a probabilistic predic-tion problem and develop a probabilistic form of re-currence framework. Under the aforementioned assump-tions, Eq.(3) can be transformed into a generalized lin-ear representation, i.e. 

Y d,t = Ψd (Xd,t ) β, (6) where βd = [ β1

β2 ] represents the sparse coefficient matrix to be identified. 

3 Methodology 

This section introduces an algorithm termed BRSL for online identification of nonlinear models in high-noise environments. Furthermore, the recursive condi-tions and convergence properties of the BRSL algorithm are investigated. 

3.1 Bayesian Regression-Based Symbolic Learning 

To enhance robustness and parsimony, regression co-efficients are often assumed to be sparse in practice, meaning that only a subset of features exerts significant influence on the outcome, thereby simplifying the model structure and improving interpretability [2,9,4]. In this study, a sparsity-inducing horseshoe prior is employed over the parameters, β ∼ p(β) [3]. Without loss of gen-erality, the regression process is formulated as in Eq.(7): 

Y d,t = Ψd(Xd,t )βd + β0, (7) Let vec( ·) denote the vectorization operation of ma-trix, we have vec( Y d,t ) = vec( Ψd(Xd,t )βd) + vec( β0). (8) Given Y t = vec( Y d,t ) ∈ Rt·ny ×1 and β = vec( βd) ∈

Rnp·ny ×1, then, 

Y t = Ψ(Xt)β + vec( β0), (9) where Ψ(Xt) = Iny ⊗ Ψd(Xd,t ) ∈ Rt·ny ×np·ny , and ⊗

represents Kronecker product. From the probabilistic perspective, Eq.(9) can be ex-pressed as 

p(Y t |β ) ∼ N (Ψ(Xt)β, Σp ⊗ It). (10) Generally, β is assumed to be sparse, and noise terms across the columns of β0 are assumed to be i.i.d., i.e vec( β0) ∼ N (0 , Σp ⊗ It), where Σp = diag (σ2 

> i

), i =1, 2, . . . , n y and σ2 

> i

denotes the measurement noise vari-ance corresponding to the i-th output. The horseshoe prior assumes that each component β

of β is conditionally independent, with its distribution given by a mixture of Gaussians 

p(βi,j |λi,j , τ ) ∼ N (0 , λ 2 

> i,j

τ 2),p(λi,j ) ∼ Half Cuachy (0 , 1) ,p(τ ) ∼ Half Cuachy (0 , 1) ,

(11) where βi,j denotes the element at the ( i, j )-th position of matrix βd; λi,j is the local shrinkage parameter for each coefficient βi,j ; τ is the global shrinkage parameter. 

Remark 1 Reliable uncertainty quantification remains a critical challenge in high-dimensional inference. How-ever, the estimates derived from Lasso regression fail to provide meaningful distributional uncertainty for param-eter estimates. The horseshoe prior demonstrates perfor-mance comparable to that of Lasso regression in sparse representation within high-dimensional spaces, while its heavy-tailed properties ensure that strong signals retain high posterior probability. More importantly, this design enables the mapping of deterministic point prediction problems into probabilistic forecasting frameworks. For further details, refer to [1]. 

As in conventional Bayesian inference, the objec-tive is to infer the posterior distribution of parameters 

β, given the observed and input sequences. Incorpo-rating the horseshoe prior assumptions and letting 

θ = diag (λ2 

> i,j

)τ 2, we obtain the following posterior 

p(β |Ψ(Xt), Y t )

∝ N (Ψ(Xt)β, Σp ⊗ It) · N (0, θ)

∝

Y

> j=1

N (yj ; Ψ(xj )β, Σp) · N (0, θ),

(12) where Ψ(xi) = Iny ⊗Ψd(xd,i ) and yi = vec( yd,i ). Since the conjugate prior of the Gaussian distribution is also a Gaussian distribution, the resulting posterior distribu-tion remains Gaussian,

(13) 3Substituting Eq.(13) into Eq.(12) leads to the follow-ing posterior distribution for the parameters β:

p(β |Ψ(Xt), Y t )

∝ exp( − 12 (Y t − Ψ(Xt)β)T (Σ−1 

> p

⊗ It)

· (Y t − Ψ(Xt)β) − 12 βT θ−1β).

(14) Assuming that the final result obtained by Bayesian inference follows the distribution N (μw, Ξw), we can then write 

(μw = ΞwΨT (Xt)( Σ−1 

> p

⊗ It)Y t,

Ξ−1 

> w

= ΨT (Xt)( Σ−1 

> p

⊗ It)Ψ(Xt) + θ−1. (15) Further, since Ψ(Xt) = Iny ⊗ Ψd(Xd,t ), Eq.(15) can be rewriting as 

(μw = Ξwvec( ΨTd (Xd,t )Y d,t Σ−1 

> p

),

Ξ−1 

> w

= Σ−1 

> p

⊗ ΨTd (Xd,t )Ψd(Xd,t ) + θ−1. (16) The above procedure constitutes the offline training phase. To address the requirement for online parameter updates in DT systems, the entire methodology must be extended to incorporate a recursive online update strat-egy. Within the framework of this study, the generalized expression for online updating is given by 

p(βt+1 |Ψ(Xt+1 ), Y t+1 )= N (μw,t +1 , Ξw,t +1 )= f [N (μw,t , Ξw,t ), Ψ(xt+1 ), y t+1 ].

(17) Considering Eq.(12)-(14), 

p(βt+1 |Ψ(Xt+1 ), Y t+1 )

∝

Y

> j=1

N (yj ; Ψ(xj )β, Σp) · N (0, θ)

· N (yt+1 ; Ψ(xt+1 )β, Σp)

∝ N (μw,t , Ξw,t ) · N (yt+1 ; Ψ(xt+1 )β, σ 2)

∝ N (μw,t +1 , Ξw,t +1 ).

(18) where 

⊗ (ΨTd (xd,t +1 )Ψd(xd,t +1 )) .

(19) In recursive processes, it is typically desirable for new data to exert greater influence on the parameter posteriors, while the contribution of historical data gradually diminishes over time. Consequently, a forget-ting factor must be introduced into Eq.(19) to control the weighting of historical data. Unlike conventional recursive algorithms, this method operates within a Bayesian inference framework where simply multiply-ing coefficients cannot achieve historical data forgetting for posterior inference. In this framework, the forget-ting factor υ functions analogously to a sliding window length. The corresponding target posterior distribu-tion p(βt+1 Ψ(X(t−υ+1: t+1) ), Y (t−υ+1: t+1) ) is given by Eq.(20). Here the subscript ( t − υ + 1 : t + 1) denotes data from time ( t − υ + 1) to ( t + 1). The symbol “/” represents division in probability computation. 

p(βt+1 Ψ(X(t−υ+1: t+1) ), Y (t−υ+1: t+1) )

Remark 2 The division operation “/” is not a primi-tive operation in probabilistic theory, implying that prob-ability spaces are not closed under the division operation. The following subsection will discuss the establishment conditions for “/” and further provide recursive rules and parameter design guidelines. 

Indeed, Eq.(21) does not constitute a standard recur-sive formulation. This is because the terms Ξ−1

> w,t

, μw,t ,

Xd,t −υ and Y d,t −υ must be recomputed from time zero during each update, contradicting the core objective of recursive efficiency. For a system with an update period of ι, Eq.(20) is extended as 

p(βt+ι Ψ(X(t−υ+ι:t+ι)), Y (t−υ+ι:t+ι) )

∝ N υ (μυw,t , Ξυw,t ) ·

(23) The central innovation of the proposed BRSL frame-work lies in its integration of a recursive structure with traditional probabilistic methods, notably through a novel probabilistic recursive scheme that incorporates a forgetting factor. However, unlike traditional point-estimation methods, the practical implementation of Bayesian recursion is subject to specific constraints. The following subsection details these recursive conditions. 

3.2 Recursive condition of BRSL

ΨTd (Xd, (1: υ))Ψd(Xd, (1: υ))

− ΨTd (Xd, (1: k))Ψd(Xd, (1: k)) ≻ 0. (30) By using Theorem 2, it is straightforward to imple-ment, we have

(31) Combining the preceding equations, we obtain the fol-lowing constraint, which is equivalent to Eq.(30),

(34) By applying Theorem 2, the invertibility of the opera-tions involved in the preceding expression is mathemat-ically ensured. Following the same reasoning as in the initial case, a recursive condition is derived that holds uniformly over the entire time domain, as shown below: 

ΨT (X(t0+1: t0+ι))Ψ(X(t0+1: t0+ι))−

ΨT (X(t0−υ+1: t0−υ+k))Ψ(X(t0−υ+1: t0−υ+k))

≻ 0.

(35) Therefore, Eq.(23) should be revised as

· Ψd(Xd, (t−υ:t−υ+k−1) )] .

(36) 

Remark 3 The variance matrix Ξυw,t in Eq. (36) must remain strictly positive definite (i.e., Ξυw,t ≻ 0) at all times during the recursive process. This requirement is guaranteed by the recursive condition specified in Eq. (35) .Furthermore, defining γ as the evaluation matrix, it has 

γ = diag (κi) ≻ 0, (37) 

where κi denotes the i-th eigenvalue of 

ΨTd (Xd, (t0+1: t0+ι))Ψd(Xd, (t0+1: t0+ι))

−ΨTd (Xd, (t0−υ+1: t0−υ+k))Ψd(Xd, (t0−υ+1: t0−υ+k)).The recursive condition can be interpreted as follows: the informational contribution of new data must consis-tently exceed that of old data. This implies that upon the arrival of new data, the computation of κi enables online assessment of data utility. Specifically: 

• If ∃κi = 0 , the incoming data is redundant with his-torical data; 

• If ∃κi < 0, the new data may contain significant noise that could compromise model stability. This mechanism effectively supports real-time data quality screening during the recursive update process. 

Indeed, during recursive updates, parameters ι and k

are inherently distinct: ι can be adaptively determined, while k is typically fixed as a hyperparameter(Typically, (υ+ι−k) is bigger than the number of unknown parame-ters, to enhance the long-term stability of the model, the value of k can be adjusted according to specific practi-cal requirements). This causes the effective window size 

υ to expand indefinitely. Artificially fixing υ resolves uncontrolled growth but introduces historical informa-tion remanence, leading to model divergence over time.

(38) The recursive framework proposed in this paper is designed to enhance the model’s adaptability to new data by dynamically updating regression parameters, thereby accelerating convergence. A key feature of this approach is the ability to flexibly balance between incor-porating new information and retaining historical sta-bility through adjustable parameters ( υ, k, ι, ξ). The re-cursive condition formally establishes a weighted infor-mation differential between new and old data, allowing the model to emphasize recent trends without compro-mising overall robustness. This enables a tunable trade-off between convergence speed and long-term stability, making the framework suitable for applications where responsive adaptation is valued. 63.3 Convergence 

Theorem 3 For a discrete-time system, let Λ (t) ∈ Rn

denotes the regression vector. If there exists constant 

α1 > 0, and a positive integer N , such that for all time instants t ≥ 0 and any unit vector vT ∈ Rn, the follow-ing inequality holds:

ΛT (k) v

≥ α1, (39) 

then the signal Λ (t) is said to satisfy the Persistent Ex-citation (PE) condition. 

Crucially, this PE condition is essentially equivalent to the conclusions established in the Sec.3.2.

then the signal Λ (t) is said to satisfy the PE condition. 

Theorem 4 If A ∈ Rn×n is a symmetric positive defi-nite matrix, then there exists a unique triangular matrix 

Λ ∈ Rn×n with strictly positive diagonal elements such that A = ΛT Λ. This factorization is termed the Cholesky decomposition. 

To reinforce the PE condition, this work requires the information matrix to be positive definite. Let 

ΛT (t + 1) Λ(t + 1) = 

ΨTd (Xd, (t+1: t+ι))ΨTd (Xd, (t+1: t+ι))

(48) Notice that E[vec( ε)] = 0, yield 

E[ ˜βt+1 ] = E[Ξυw,t +1 ξ(Ξυw,t )−1 ˜βt]= E[ξt+1 Ξυw,t +1 (Ξ υw, 0)−1 ˜β0], (49) 7hence, lim

4 Numerical simulations 

This section presents a numerical experiment to val-idate the accuracy and convergence of the proposed re-cursive scheme, along with a complex system case study to demonstrate the practical utility of the BRSL frame-work. 

4.1 Case study 1 

Symbol learning forms the core of the entire frame-work, where the accuracy of system identification and the sparsity of the regression parameters critically determine its downstream performance. The sparsity-inducing horseshoe prior applied within the symbol learning framework has been proven effective for system identification [3]. While Carvalho et al. extensively dis-cussed horseshoe priors in traditional supervised learn-ing settings—including linear regression, generalized linear models, and functional estimation—this section validates their efficacy, and that of the broader BRSL framework, through a concise numerical case study. The dataset is generated from y ∼ N (Xβ , σ 2I), where the design matrix X ∈ Rn×m is drawn from a uniform distribution on ( −0.5, 0.5], and the regression coefficient vector β is sparse. In this probabilistic model, the coefficients β represent the mean parameters of the Gaussian distribution. This experiment evaluates the estimation accuracy of this m-dimensional mean vec-tor. We simulated 100 datasets with each β containing approximately 30% non-zero parameters. The non-zero parameters were generated from a uniform distribution on (5 , 10], and additive Gaussian noise with zero mean and variance 0.1 was applied to the data. Fig.1 and Fig.2 show the distributions of the abso-lute estimation errors for the non-zero and zero-valued parameters, respectively. The results demonstrate that the horseshoe prior provides strong performance in sys-tem identification under noisy conditions. It achieves high precision in estimating the true values of non-zero parameters within systems containing multiple stochas-tic elements, while effectively suppressing the estimates of zero-valued parameters toward zero throughout the sparse recovery process. 1 3 5 7 9 11 13 15 Parameter number -2 024Absolute error 10 -1

Fig. 3. The prediction of BRSL before and after the change of working conditions 

This characteristic is exquisitely aligned with the fun-damental requirements of sparse representation in sym-bol learning and the online probabilistic recursion of Bayesian symbolic learning. To validate the convergence and robustness of the re-cursive algorithm, an abrupt change in operating condi-tions was introduced at a random point during the simu-lation. Fig. 3 shows the resulting distribution of non-zero parameters before and after the change, where triangles and pentagrams represent the true post-change and pre-change coefficients, respectively. Fig. 4 illustrates the convergence behavior of the means and variances dur-ing the iterative process. After the change, the coeffi-cients do not converge gradually but exhibit a step-like decline, which is due to the recursive condition in the BRSL method that ensures absolute convergence. Both figures visually demonstrate the strong convergence ca-pability and robustness of the BRSL method. 500 1000 1500 2000 2500 3000 3500 4000 4500 Time Step -5 05Relative Error Operating Condition Change

4.2 Case study 2 

In this illustrative example, a state-space model of Lorenz is utilized to validate the performance of the BRSL. The model is described as 



˙x1 = k1(x2 − x1) + v1

˙x2 = x1(28 − x3) − x2 + v2

˙x3 = x1x2 − k3x3 + v3

x0 =



−8727 

, (56) where v1, v2 and v3 represent system noise, assumed to follow a standard normal distribution, i.e., v ∼ N (0, 1). The coefficients to be identified, k1 and k2, are defined as time-varying functions: 

k1 = 0 .5sin (0 .1t) + 10 ,k3 = arctan (0 .1t) + 3 . (57) The effectiveness of the proposed method is validated under time-varying parameter scenarios. During mod-eling, two cases are considered: one where the system model is fully known, and another where it is partially unknown (with x2 being a known state, while x1 and 

x3 are entirely unknown). For sparse identification, a li-brary of second-order polynomial basis functions of the state variables is constructed. Fig.5 and Fig.6 present the SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) value analysis, which quantifies the con-tribution of each basis function to the system output. The results demonstrate that the BRSL method effec-tively drives the model to converge to the true complex system over time, confirming its strong identification ca-pability. Furthermore, Fig.7 and Fig.8 show the simu-lation results for state variables x1 and x3. Even under 90.5 1 1.5 2 2.5 3 3.5 4Time Step 10 4

5 Conclusions 

In conclusion, this work unifies interpretability with uncertainty-aware online learning via a Bayesian sym-bolic regression framework, establishing a new paradigm for system identification that delivers full posterior dis-tributions over parsimonious governing equations. The proposed BRSL method provides a robust foundation for real-time symbolic learning through stable recursive conditions, a forgetting mechanism, and provable con-vergence guarantees. This approach enables dynamic, trustworthy models critical for applications such as DTs, bridging long-standing gaps between computational ef-ficiency, probabilistic rigor, and interpretability for de-ployment in real-world streaming data environments. Future work will extend the framework to distributed learning and non-stationary dynamics.
