Abstract — Sparse Identification of Nonlinear Dynamics 

(SINDy ) is a powerful method for discovering parsimonious 

governing equations from data, but it often requires expert 

tuning of candidate libraries. We propose an LLM -aided SINDy 

pipeline that iteratively refines candidate equations using a large 

language model (LLM) in the loop through in -context learning .

The pipeline begins with a baseline SINDy model fit using an 

adaptive library and then enters a LLM -guided refinement 

cycle. At each iteration, the current best equations, error 

metrics, and domain -specific co nstraints are summarized in a 

prompt to the LLM, which suggests new equation structures. 

These candidate equations are parsed against a defined symbolic 

form and evaluated on training and test data. The pipeline uses 

simulation -based error as a primary met ric, but also assesses 

structural similarity to ground truth, including matching 

functional forms, key terms, couplings, qualitative behavior. An 

iterative stopping criterion ends refinement early if test error 

falls below a threshold (NRMSE < 0.1) or if a maximum of 10 

iterations is reached. Finally, the best model is selected, and w e

evaluate this LLM -aided SINDy on 63 dynamical system 

datasets (ODEBench) and march leuba model for boiling 

nuclear reactor. The results are compare d against classical 

SINDy and show the LLM -loop consistently improves symbolic 

recovery with higher equation similarity to ground truth and 

lower test RMSE than baseline SINDy for cases with complex 

dynamics. This work demonstrates that an LLM can effectively 

guide SINDy’s search th rough equation space, integrating data -

driven error feedback with domain -inspired symbolic reasoning 

to discover governing equations that are not only accurate but 

also structurally interpretable. 

I. INTRODUCTION 

Discovering governing equations from time -series data is a 

central challenge in data -driven modeling of dynamical systems. 

Sparse regression approaches such as SINDy (Sparse Identification 

of Nonlinear Dynamics) [ [1] ] have proven successful at identifying 

compact analytic laws that explain observed dynamics, by fitting 

time derivatives to a hand -crafted library of candidate nonlinear 

features. Classical SINDy requires a priori choosing of a function 

library and the thresholding of small coefficients to enforce sparsity, 

both based on human judgement. Such an approach may struggle 

with complex systems in which the true dynamics involve complex 

terms outside the basic library. 

Recent advances have shown promise by incorporating 

machine learning and prior knowledge into equation discovery. 

Beyond the original formulation, a number of SINDy variants have 

been developed to improve robustness, uncertainty handling, and 

applicability under limited or noisy data. Weak SINDy replaces 

pointwise derivative estimation with a weak/Galerkin formulation ,

substantially improving noise robustness by converting 

differentiation into integration against test functions [2] . Ensemble -

SINDy further improves stability in the low -data/high -noise regime 

by using bootstrap aggregating to obtain inclusion probabilities over 

candidate terms, enabling both robust recovery and uncertainty 

quantification at the level of discovered structures [3] . For control -

oriented settings, probabilistic extensions such as Multivariate 

Gaussian Fit SINDyC (MvG -SINDyC) aggregate ensembles of 

SINDyC models to quantify uncertainty and improve reliability 

when simulation -trained models exhibit discrepancies against 

experimental trajectories  [4] . Besides, deep learning models such as 

neural ordinary differential equations (ODEs)  [5]  or transformer -

based regressors  [6] , [7]  navigate the search space of equations, but 

often do so as black boxes, without yielding human -readable 

formulas. Related scientific machine learning approaches also 

embed physical constraints into neural surrogates (e.g., physics -

informed neural networks) to infer latent dynamics and parameters 

from sparse observations, trading symbolic transparency for function 

appr oximation flexibility  [8] . Hybrid strategies have also been 

explored where neural networks expand or learn feature 

representations that are subsequently sparsified (or otherwise 

regularized) to regain interpretability, partially mitigating fixed -

library limitations  [9] .

There is growing interest in using large language models 

(LLMs), which contain broad scientific knowledge, to guide the 

search for equations. LLMs can suggest relevant functional forms or 

transformations based on patterns in data or domain context, 

effecti vely injecting expert intuition into the search process. At the 

same time, leveraging domain -specific insights such as data 

characteristics or known behaviors of function families can prune out 

implausible candidates and bias the search toward correct solu tions. 

In this work, we explore augmenting the SINDy algorithm with 

an LLM to adaptively propose new candidate terms and structures 

based on data characteristics, model context, and performance, and 

we clarify how this differs from both SINDy variants and end -to -end 

learning -based equation discovery. Weak SINDy, Ensemble -SINDy, 

and probabilistic SINDyC extensions primarily improve robustness 

and uncertainty quantification given a predefined dictionary class; 

however, when the governing dynamics lie outside the ass umed 

candidate families, performance can degrade due to library 

misspecification even if regression and uncertainty estimates are 

well -behaved  [2] -[4] . Our approach targets this complementary 

failure mode: rather than only stabilizing coefficient recovery within 

a fixed library, the LLM -in -the -loop proposes new functional 

families and compositions driven by closed -loop feedback from 

simulation error and structural constraints. In contrast to deep 

learning surrogates that can fit trajectories with high expressivity but 

may not yield compact symbolic laws, we retain a sparse -regression 

backbone and explicit symbolic representations, so that every 

refinement remains interpretable and verifiable by simulation. 

Compared with transformer symbolic regressors that attempt to infer 

equations directly from trajectories, our pipeline uses the LLM as a 

constrained hypothesis generator within an explicit validation -and -

selection loop, allowing domain constraints and multimodal context 

(metadata and diagnostic plots) to steer the search while maintaining 

transparent acceptan ce criteria. We integrate an LLM into a closed -

loop pipeline: after an initial SINDy fit, the LLM receives a summary 

# In -Context System Identification for Nonlinear Dynamics Using 

# Large Language Models 

# Linyu Li nof the current model’s performance and suggests improvements in a 

structured format. These suggestions are validated and evaluated, 

and the cycle repeats until a maximum number of iterations is 

reached. The goal is to leverage the LLM’s ability to suggest novel 

combinations of features and functional forms beyond a fixed 

library, guided by error feedback and domain constraints. 

II. METHOD 

We propose an iterative sparse -regression pipeline in which a 

large language model (LLM) serves as a constrained hypothesis 

generator that proposes candidate equation structures, while an 

automated validation -and -selection loop accepts only candidates 

that (i) can be parsed under a restricted symbolic grammar, (ii) can 

be fit with linear -in -parameters sparse regression, and (iii) 

accurately reproduce forward -simulated trajectories on held -out 

data. The overall procedure alternates between (1) fitting and 

si mulating candidate ODEs, and (2) prompting the LLM with 

compact diagnostics (data characteristics, baseline behavior, error 

focus, and prior attempts) to propose locally improved or globally 

redesigned structures. This mirrors how a domain expert iterative ly 

refines a model using error feedback, but enforces transparent 

acceptance criteria and repeatable scoring.  Fig. 1 shows the 

schematic of LLM -aided sparse identification workflow. The 

method is designed to make the search over functional forms 

explicit, interpretable , and constrained, rather than relying only on 

sparse symbolic regression :

1. Baseline fit, empirical data characterization, and structural 

priors : Given a multivariate trajectory  𝑥 (𝑡 ) ∈ ℝ𝑑 , we first compute 

compact empirical summaries of each state on the training segment 

(e.g., range, standard deviation, basic monotonicity/oscillation 

indicators, approximate period when applicable, and simple 

saturation heuristics). These statistics are us ed for two purposes: (i) 

to populate the LLM prompt with interpretable behavioral cues like 

“oscillatory” or “saturating”, and (ii) to derive lightweight structural 

priors that guide which function families are preferred, optional, or 

discouraged for each state derivative. In parallel, we fit an initial 

“baseline” sparse -regression model using a fixed, broad candidate 

dictionary to obtain: (i) baseline equations, (ii) train/test derivative -

fit scores, (iii) trajectory rollout error on held -out data, and (iv ) a 

trust label per derivative that reflects whether the baseline is 

numerically reliable for that equation . For example, if the baseline 

provides a strong fit and stable rollout predictions . These baseline 

diagnostics are not only used for comparison , they also condition the 

subsequent refinement loop by informing which families should be 

emphasized or de -emphasized, and by enabling safeguards during 

final model selection. 

2. Seed model and iterative refinement protocol : We initialize the 

refinement loop with a parsimonious seed structure (typically a 

minimal set of linear terms), fit its coefficients via sparse regression, 

and evaluate it using forward simulation on the test interval. The 

refinement loop then proceeds for up to a fixed iteration budget (e.g., 

10) or until an early -stopping criterion is met. At each iteration, we 

identify an error focus that prioritizes the state(s) with the largest 

normalized test error, enc ouraging targeted improvements without 

destabilizing already well -fit derivatives. We also track short -term 

improvement; if recent iterations show a plateau with insufficient 

relative error reduction over a small window, the loop increases 

exploration by raising LLM sampling diversity and requesting more 

candidates. This implements a pragmatic exploration –exploitation 

strategy without changing the underlying spars e-regression 

backbone. 

3. Prompt construction and constrained candidate generation by 

the LLM : At each iteration, the algorithm assembles a structured 

prompt that encodes the current identification context in a compact, 

machine -consumable form. The prompt includes the variable and 

constant metadata , including their names, units, and any known 

parameter values, empirically derived data -characterization 

summaries for each state, including range and qualitative behaviors 

such as oscillation or saturation, and the current -best and baseline 

equations accompanied by their diagnostic reliability indicators. It 

also embeds structural priors that express soft preferences over 

admissible function f amilies for each state derivative, together with 

a short memory of recently rejected candidates to discourage 

repetition. Finally, the prompt enforces hard output constraints: the 

returned candidates must be sparse, must respect the allowed 

symbo lic grammar, and must remain linear in unknown coefficients 

so that each derivative can be written in the generic form .

𝑥 ̇𝑖 (𝑡 ) = ∑ 𝜃 𝑖 ,𝑘 𝜙 𝑘 (𝑥 (𝑡 ), 𝑢 (𝑡 ), 𝑡 )𝐾  

> 𝑘 =1

()

where  𝜙 𝑘 (⋅)are admissible features that are selected from a

constrained library and  𝜃 𝑖 ,𝑘  are scalar coefficients to be fit by sparse 

regression. The LLM is then asked to produce multiple candidate 

equation templates in a strictly parseable format so they can be 

automatically validated, fit, and scored. When available, the prompt 

may additional ly include a compact diagnostic visualization or 

summary of recent rollout behavior so the LLM can target qualitative 

failure modes such as phase lag, drift, damping mismatch, or 

frequency error. 

4. Candidate validation, fitting, simulation -based evaluation, 

and novelty filtering : Each candidate produced by the LLM is 

passed through an automated validation pipeline prior to scoring. 

The first gate enforces syntactic correctness and grammar 

compliance, rejecting any proposal that uses disallowed operators or 

variables, violates the permissible functional forms, or breaks 

linearity in coefficients . F or example, coefficients are not allowed to 

be put inside nonlinear functions, denominators, or exponents. For 

candidates that pass syntax, the pipeline enforces sparsity and 

redundancy constraints by limiting the number of retained terms per 

equation and discarding candidates , whose term signatures match 

previously tested structures . Such constraints prevent the pipeline 

from cycling and improve exploration efficiency. Valid and novel 

candidates then undergo coefficient estimation on the training 

segment via sparse regression under the proposed feature str ucture, 

after which they are evaluated using forward simulation on the test 

interval with robust numerical integration settings and a strict wall -

clock timeout to prevent pathological models from stalling the run. 

Candidates that fail to simulate due to divergence, numerical blow -

up, or timeout are assigned a dominating penalty with effectively

infinite rollout error, ensuring they are not selected in future 

iterations . For candidates that successfully simulate, the primary 

metric is the normalized trajectory error computed per state and 

aggregated via the maximum across states to reflect worst -case 

predictive fidelity; auxiliary diagnostics such as derivative -level fit 

can be retained for analysis but do not supersede rollout accuracy in 

selection. 

5. Multi -objective scoring, early stopping, and final model 

selection : Among successfully evaluated candidates in a given 

iteration, selection is performed using a multi -objective score that 

balances predictive accuracy with parsimony and prior consistency. 

Concretely, each candidate is assigned a scalar objective of the form 

𝐽 = max  

> 𝑖

𝑁𝑅𝑀𝑆𝐸 𝑖 + 𝜆 𝑐 𝒞 + 𝜆 𝑝 𝒫  ()

where  max  

> 𝑖

𝑁𝑅𝑀𝑆𝐸 𝑖  is the maximum test normalized root mean 

squared error (NRMSE) over states,  𝒞  is a normalized symbolic 

complexity measure that counts expression -tree node, and  𝒫  is a 

penalty that increases when the candidate violates or unnecessarily 

proliferates function families relative to the structural priors. This 

formulation biases the search toward compact, interpretable 

equations when multiple candidates achieve comparabl e rollout 

fidelity. The loop terminates early when the selected candidate 

achieves a sufficiently low maximum test NRMSE, implemented as 

a threshold test  max  

> 𝑖

𝑁𝑅𝑀𝑆𝐸 𝑖 < 𝜏  with  𝜏  set, for example, to 0.1, 

and otherwise continues until the iteration budget is exhausted. After 

termination, the algorithm returns the best candidate observed across 

all iterations; additionally, when the baseline model is labeled 

reliable, a safeguard is applied to prevent selecting an LLM -refined 

model that is materially worse than the baseline on held -out rollout 

error, thereby ensuring the closed -loop process does not regress 

below a strong initial solution. 

Through these steps, our method is intended to balance 

accuracy and interpretability. The LLM proposals inject flexibility 

to capture complex behaviors that a fixed library would miss in 

classical SINDy, while the domain constraints and validation steps 

gu ard against nonsense solutions and overfitting. We also 

incorporate domain -specific knowledge automatically via structural 

priors, and use simulation error as a feedback channel. Model 

selection is not purely based on sparsity and error, but also on 

struct ural alignment with expectations (via penalties). In essence, 

classical SINDy yields a single model, which may or may not be 

correct, whereas our LLM -aided SINDy generates a sequence of 

models, enabling course -correction and guided exploration of the 

searc h space of equations. 

III. EXPERIMENTAL SETUP 

We evaluated our approach on ODEBench benchmark  [7]  and 

one nuclear -specific problem  [11] . The ODEBench consists of 63 

diverse ODE systems collected from the literature —specifically, 23 

1-D systems, 28 2 -D systems, 10 3 -D systems, and 2 4 -D systems —

thus covering a wide range of dynamics. Among these are four 

known chaotic systems (e.g., variants of Lorenz or other chaot ic 

attractors) as well as many standard nonlinear systems, including 

predator -prey models, oscillators, and reaction kinetics. Each task 

provides a reference “ground truth” ODE, which we treated as 

unknown during our discovery process, along with a set of trajectory 

data generated from that ODE. In addition, we introduce a March –

Leuba boiling water reactor (BWR) reduced -order benchmark  [11] 

that captures coupled neutron kinetics and reactivity feedback effects 

and is widely used as a surrogate for BWR stability studies. 

For each system, we used a single trajectory for training and 

testing. Typically, we simulated the system over a certain time span 

and with a given initial condition in order to obtain the state 

trajectory. We split the data: the first portion of the time series was 

used to train the model (fitting the ODE), and a later portion (or a 

separate trajectory from a different initial condition, if provided) 

served as a test set to evaluate how well the discovered model 

generalizes and predicts future behavior. Fo r the March –Leuba 

BWR benchmark, we generated ODEBench -compatible training and 

test trajectories via closed -loop simulation around distinct setpoint 

schedules, and exported the control action as an additional 

exogenous “state -like” regressor to support con trolled -dynamics 

identification while preventing the discovery process from inventing 

spurious control dynamics. To avoid knowledge leakage, no 

information other than the numerical simulation data was fed to our 

algorithms. 

We compared our LLM -augmented approach against a baseline 

symbolic regression that uses a fixed library of candidate terms. No 

noise s are imposed on simulation data. The baseline was configured 

with a reasonably comprehensive library, including polynomials in 

each state variable up to a certain degree and common nonlinear 

functions such as  𝑠𝑖𝑛 , 𝑐𝑜𝑠 , exponential and logarithm. This baseline 

employed the same sparse regression algorithm without any library 

adaptation, which is essentially akin to a stan dard SINDy approach 

with an expert -chosen library. Both our method and the baseline 

shared the same initial library, while LLM continues expanding the 

function library based on context and model performance, which 

highlights the value of adaptive term disc overy. For the March –

Leuba benchmark, we retained the same evaluation protocol but 

emphasized polynomial and bilinear structure during adaptive 

refinement to reflect the model’s canonical feedback couplings and 

lag dynamics. 

We evaluated performance by using both quantitative error 

metrics and qualitative structural metrics. For numerical accuracy, 

we report the coefficient of determination ( 𝑅 2) and NRMSE for the 

model predictions vs. the ground truth, on both the training data and 

the test data. A high test  𝑅 2 (close to 1.0) and a low NRMSE indicate 

that the model predicts the system’s behavior accurately. 

For structural recovery, we categorize results as “good” if the 

derived model captures major terms or behaviors in ground truth 

equations. This is the most common outcome, with the model able 

to reproduce the logistic growth’s  𝑥  and  𝑥 2 terms but adding an extra 

small term. In other words, the model reflects the right structure but 

slightly different coefficients. For a good fit, we require at least the 

correct qualitative behavior or some key term overlap. The structural 

recovery is “fa iled” if the model is structurally wrong such that it 

likely represents a different mechanism. These grades allow us to 

quantify how often our method not only makes good predictions but 

also “discovers” the physics instead of just producing a black -box 

fit . In this manner, we graded both the baseline and our LLM -based 

method on each of the 63 tasks. 

IV. RESULTS 

A. ODE Benchmark 

Across the ODEBench suite, our LLM -augmented approach 

demonstrated improved prediction accuracy on a majority of the 

tasks, unlike the fixed -library baseline. Specifically, out of 63 

systems, our method achieved early stop criteria with NRMSE = 

<0.1 on 48 of them, as opposed to 30 for the baseline. The median 

error for the baseline is around 62% of variable range, whereas for 

the LLM -aided method it is 3.4%. The error spread is also much 

tighter with LLM augmentation. Baseline SINDy has five cases with 

infinite error, but our pipeline managed to find a stable model in all 

cases. Excluding divergent cases, the mean baseline NRMSE was 

still 43%, as compared to 3.4% for the LLM -aided method. Fig ure 2 

shows the distribution of the test NRMSEs for the baseline SINDy 

(orange) and LLM -aided SINDy (blue). In terms of structural recovery, the results highlight an important 

trade -off. The baseline, while often unable to fit the data when its 

library was insufficient, did recover dominant forms in 26 of the 63 

cases. But our LLM -based method managed to recover 36 —a

substantially higher rate of good structural recovery. The results 

show that the LLM’s guidance increases the chance of finding a 

model with good predictive accuracy and reasonable complexity, at 

the expense of sometimes introducing extra terms or di fferent 

functional forms that deviate from the true physics. The baseline is 

more binary: it either has the right ingredients for obtaining an exact 

solution, or it fails and produces nothing useful, since it will not 

consider functions outside its preset library. 

To illustrate the above outcomes, we now discuss a few 

representative systems. 

Linear oscillator, odebench24: The ground truth is a 2D mass -

spring system without damping  𝑥 ̇ = 𝑦 , 𝑦 ̇ = 2.1𝑥 . Because the data 

are oscillatory, the baseline included sinusoids and returned a very 

complicated model:  𝑥 ̇ = 150 .93 𝑦 − 19 .78 𝑦 3 −

160 .36 sin (𝑦 ) + 5.21 sin (2𝑦 ) + ⋯ and a similarly lengthy  𝑦 ̇ .

Essentially, the baseline uses many Fourier and polynomial terms to 

fit the periodic motion. It achieved  𝑅 ² ~1 in training, but the model 

is not physically correct. On the other hand, the LLM identified this 

as a harmonic oscillator and proposed linear coupling terms. By 

iteration 2 it had obtained:  𝑥 ̇ = 0.998 𝑦 , 𝑦 ̇ = −2.098 𝑥 , which are 

exact forms, just with rounding differences. Fig ure 3 compares the 

manual and LLM -aided SINDy predictions. This case shows the 

LLM excelling at interpretation by replacing a baseline fit with the 

concise true law. Even though the baseline had near -zero error, our 

selection favored the LLM’s simpler model. This hints at the 

advantage of combining error and compl exity in selection —the 

pipeline did not just settle for the overfit baseline. 

Exponential forcing, odebench21: The ground truth is a 1D 

model with exponential component:  𝑥 ̇ = 1.2 − 0.2𝑥 − 𝑒 −𝑥 . The 

manual baseline introduces a trigonometric surrogate  𝑥 ̇ = 0.626 𝑥 −

0.122 𝑥 2 + 0.230 𝑐𝑜𝑠 (𝑥 ) instead of the exponential decay 

mechanism, leading to a model with wrong structural format but 

good test metrics test R² ≈ 0.975; NRMSE ≈ 4.9×10⁻³. The LLM -

aided pipeline starts from a baseline with only polynomial cubic. The 

LLM’s selected candidate explicitly introduced an exponential 

feature  𝑥 ̇ = −0.8963 𝑥 + 0.0634 𝑥 2 − 3.1555 exp (−0.5𝑥 ) +

3.3728 , aligning with the ground truth’s exponential decay. Figure 

4 compares the manual and LLM -aided SINDy predictions. The 

resulting fitted model includes an exponential term and produces 

stronger test rollouts test R² ≈ 0.995; NRMSE ≈ 2.5×10⁻³. However, 

the recovered exponential is exp(−0.5x) rather than exp(−x) and 

coefficients differ partly due to feature -grid constraints and 

regression trade -offs, but this case demonstrates a key advantage of 

LLM guidance: it can pivot the library toward the qualitati vely 

correct mechanism rather than relying on periodic surrogates. 

SIR -type bilinear coupling, odebench31: The ground truth 

features a rational saturation term plus a linear damping:  𝑥 ̇ =

−0.4𝑥𝑦 ; 𝑦 ̇ = 0.4𝑥𝑦 − 0.314 𝑦 . The manual model includes 

incorrect higher -order/trigonometric structure, and the test rollout is 

unstable with test R² ≈ −23.34 and NRMSE ≈ 0.063/0.082. From the 

baseline fitting, LLM is able to realize and suggests that binlinear 

coupling term of  𝑥𝑦  is the central driver of  𝑥 ̇ . LLM also realizes that 

Fourier terms in  𝑦 ̇ are irrelevant as no oscillation behaviors are 

observed from data characteristics. As a result, the LLM’s selected 

candidate emphasizes the bilinear term and linear decay, yielding a 

compact model where the learned coefficients closely match ground 

truth . The test rollout is accurate and stable with test R² ≈ 0.994 and 

NRMSE ≈ 3.8×10⁻⁴. Here, LLM guidance functions as a structural 

denoiser by remov ing weakly supported nuisance terms that the 

baseline regression included, while preserving the essential 

coupling. 

Cross -coupled polynomial, odebench39 : The ground truth 

contains an  𝑥 2𝑦  term that couples two equations:  𝑥 ̇ = −𝑥 + 2.4𝑦 +

𝑥 ̇ vs rollout trajectories .𝑥 2𝑦 , 𝑦 ̇ = −0.07 − 2.4𝑐 + 𝑥 2𝑦 . The baseline’s polynomial library 

did include  𝑥 2𝑦  terms; however, it struggled due to multi -

collinearity and ended up with  𝑥 ̇ = −0.892 𝑥 + 319 .36 𝑦 +

0.968 𝑥 2 𝑦 − 204 .087 𝑥 3 − 0.1 sin (𝑥 ) + …, with  𝑦 ̇ being a similar 

combination of high -order polynomial and Fourier terms. The 

baseline’s simulation results in a very large test  𝑅 ², indicating poor 

generalizations. The LLM added the coupling term, and the final 

model was  𝑥 ̇ = −0.972 𝑥 + 2.427 𝑦 , 𝑦 ̇ = −2.416 𝑥 −

0.0342 𝑦 + 0.070 . Although it still missed the  𝑥 2𝑦  term, it avoided 

all spurious trigonometric, exponential, and high -order terms seen in 

the baseline fit. Metrics improved drastically over the baseline, with 

test  𝑅 ² = ~0.999 vs. the baseline’s negative  𝑅 ², and NRMSE = 

~0.007 vs. the baseline’s 0.06. 

Rotational shear -flow dynamics, odebench35 : The ground truth 

is a 2D non -polynomial trigonometric form involving cotangent and 

squared trigonometric terms:  𝑥 ̇ = cot 𝑦 cos 𝑥 ; 𝑦 ̇ = sin 𝑥 cos 2 𝑦 +

4.2 sin 2 𝑦 . Both methods exhibit severe test instability with negative 

test R² and large NRMSE; the LLM -aided run terminates by because 

max imum number of iterations is reached with test R² ≈ −1.28×10⁵; 

NRMSE ≈ 1.84, while manual SINDy is even more unstable with test 

R² extremely negative; NRMSE ≈ 2.71/2.00. Although it is 

suggested in the prompt that Fourier/polynomial surrogates should 

be used . The key limitation is  cot 𝑦  and products such as  sin 𝑥 cos 2 𝑦 

require either explicit cot and producted -trig features or more 

expressive compositional bases than the fixed candidate grids 

provide. The LLM can suggest sin/cos terms, but without the right 

compositional primitives the regression compensates with many 

terms and extreme coefficients, wh ich destabilizes rollout. 

B. March -Leuba Reactor Model 

The March –Leuba benchmark is a 7-state closed -loop reactor 

stability model with known lag chains and reactivity coupling, with 

one channel corresponding to a control action. The LLM prompt 

includes explicit equation -specific guidance, sensor/actuator lags, 

and bilinear reactivity coupling in  𝑥 ̇ . The manual baseline produces 

an extremely large polynomial model that diverges under rollout, 

leading to infinite NRMSE and a wildly negative test R². This is 

consistent with over -parameterized fits in a stiff, feedback -driven 

setting: small coefficient errors accumulate and destabilize 

simulation, especially when the control channel is treated as an 

ordinary state without a consistent exogenous rollout treatment. The 

LLM -aided run produces a sparse bilinear/polynomial structure for 

𝑥̇  term and linear couplings, with good -looking one -step/fit statistics 

but poor long -horizon generalization (test R² ≈ 0.871; max NRMSE 

≈ 6.68). Figure 5 compares the llm -aided SINDy rollout predictions 

against ground truth .

Overall, the LLM -aided pipeline significantly outperforms 

manual SINDy at recovering governing equations in most cases, and 

also incorporates safeguards to avoid worse solutions. The integration 

of simulation testing and an LLM -based expert system for prop osing 

new terms is a promising direction for system identification, 

effectively emulating a human iteration on a model. 

V. CONCLUSION 

We introduced an LLM -aided SINDy pipeline that combines 

sparse regression with LLM -driven symbolic reasoning for nonlinear 

system identification. Through iterative prompting, the LLM 

proposes new equation structures that, when validated and fit, lead 

to mo re accurate and more interpretable models than afforded by a 

one -shot SINDy approach. On the 63 benchmark systems, our 

pipeline improved the rate of good equation recovery and drastically 

reduced the number of catastrophic failures. It adaptively built 

lib raries containing appropriate functional forms (e.g., polynomial, 

trigonometric, rational), guided by both data characteristics and 

LLM insight rather than relying on a fixed library. 

This approach effectively automates the work a modeling 

expert might do: observe model errors, hypothesize new terms, test 

said terms, and iterate —all within a single algorithmic loop. The 

LLM serves as a creative generator of hypotheses, while error -drive n

selection and domain filters ensure that only viable hypotheses are 

retained. The result is a system identification method that is data -

efficient and yields models that align more closely with the 

underlying physics. 

However, the current pipeline is not guaranteed to find the true 

model in every case. Its success depends on the LLM’s ability to 

suggest relevant terms, as well as on the data being informative 

enough. In extremely noisy or chaotic systems, it may still f all short. 

The LLM’s suggestions can sometimes overshoot with needless 

complexity or wrong functional forms, making our validation and 

selection steps crucial. There is also an implicit reliance on the 

LLM’s training knowledge, with it potentially favoring certain 

functional forms it “knows” and thereby possibly biasing the search. 

However, our results show that bias often pushes toward the correct 

simplicity. 

In future works, we will extend this framework to partial 

differential equations or delay differential equations, with LLMs 

suggesting spatial derivatives or delay terms. Another avenue is to 

use multiple LLMs to cross -verify proposals, or to employ a “cri tic” 

model to evaluate the physical plausibility of equations. One could 

also integrate this with laboratory experiment loops, with the LLM 

perhaps suggesting new experiments to pin down ambiguous terms.
